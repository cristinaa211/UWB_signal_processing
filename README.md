# UWB_signal_processing
Ultra-wideband (UWB) signals are signals of duration of nanoseconds in
time domain, occupying a very large frequency bandwidth of GHz order. UWB is
used for surveillance, detection, positioning and other applications due to its fine
temporal resolution and low emission power. This paper presents some signal
processing methods for UWB signal such as Envelope Detection via Hilbert
Transform, Power Spectral Density Estimation via Welchâ€™s method, Baseband
Conversion, Matched Filter and Search Subtract and Readjust algorithm.
